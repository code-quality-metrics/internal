# Code Quality Road Map

A high level overview of the CQ Roadmap, for individual tasks we use Github Projects

Tools for Efficiency and Quality

## CQ MVP

- [ ] Basic Website
- [ ] Documentation and Blog
- [ ] First App

The goal of this step is to start testing technologies and architecture with a real world App.

We need to implement a basic App, Web or Native, with its whole infrastructure: DevOps, Databases, Security, Backend, Admin, Frontend, Analytics, Logs, Performance measuring, etc.

We should start to recognize which services we can take out of the project itself and send them to Code Quality. Some examples could be:

- Authentication Micro Service
- Selection of Technologies
- Logging
- Selection of Standards, linting, etc.
- Measuring performance

The idea is to create an Industry Level Open Source Application in order to demostrate the qualifications of the CQ Team and as a Corner Stone of this project.
